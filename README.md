# Battery_cell_voltage_balancing_techniques
Cell balancing is a method to keep in check the voltages and SOC of individual cells  connected in series in a battery pack. When the battery pack is assembled it is made sure that  the cells have the same cell chemistry, but due to the constant charging and discharging  anomalies arises which thereafter tend to various changes in the cells health and other  factors. This develops a situation in which the voltages of the cells become different at the  same time which causes cell unbalancing, So to counter this cell balancing is used. We can  imagine a chariot which is being pulled by 4 horses. If any one horse is running slow then  the others have to slow themselves down to match the slow horse or if one horse is running  faster than the others then it will be dragging the chariot, thus, we need an equilibrium so  that we can pull the chariot with maximum efficiency. Similarly, we also need cell  balancing to make sure we run our BMS and battery pack at its maximum efficiency
